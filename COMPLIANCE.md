## üîí **Security Architecture**

### Defense in Depth Strategy

1. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Content Security Policy
   - HTTP security headers

2. **Application Security**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection

3. **Data Security**
